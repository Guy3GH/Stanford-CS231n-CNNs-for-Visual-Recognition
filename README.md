# CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition - Assignments Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the assignments of Stanford's [CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) "Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition" course (Spring 2020).

The selected framework been used is **PyTorch**.

**Introduction:**

Stanford's course [CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) "Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition" is one of the best ways to dive into Deep Learning in general, in particular, into Computer Vision. If you plan to excel in another subfiled of DL (say, NLP or Reinforcement Learning), we still recommend that you start with cs231n, because it gives you fundamental understanding and hands-on skills. Beware, the course is very challenging! 

To motivate you to work as hard as Stanford's students, here are actual applications that you'll implement in A3 - style transfer and class visualization.

**NOTE -** A big part of the solutions actually hides in the **.py** files (besides the .ipynb files listed below), which can be reached from this repo folders.

- **GPU:**
For some parts of the 3rd assignment, you'll need GPUs. Google Colaboratory has worked to me just fine.
